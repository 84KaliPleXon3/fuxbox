News in 1.1.0:
    * Changed syntax for window cycling.
      Instead of bitmask, the window cycling functions takes a list of
      options enclosed in {} followed by pattern, similar to those used in 
      the apps file.
    * Added new placement policies {Row,Col}MinOverlapPlacement. They 
      behave the same as {Row,Col}SmartPlacement when the window fits but
      fall back on minimizing overlap with other windows instead of
      CascadePlacement.
    * New options to client patterns:
      - focushidden
      - fullscreen
      - head
      - iconhidden
      - layer
      - minimized
      - maximized
      - shaded
      - stuck
      - transient
      - urgent
      - workspace
      - workspacename
    * New commands:
      - Attach
      - ClientMenu
      - Delay
      - Focus
      - ForEach
      - GoToWindow
      - If
      - StartMoving
      - StartResizing
      - StartTabbing
      - SetDecor
      - SetTitle 
      - SetTitleDialog
      - SetLayer
    * New modifiers to keys file:
      - OnToolbar
      - OnWindow
      - OnTitlebar
      - Double
    * New resources:
      - session.screen<N>.tabs.usePixmap: <boolean>
      - session.screen<N>.maxIgnoreIncrement: <boolean>
      - session.screen<N>.noFocusWhileTypingDelay: <int>
      - session.screen<N>.maxDisable{Move,Resize}: <boolean>
      - session.screen<N>.slit.acceptKdeDockapps: <boolean>
    * New Resize modes:
      NearestEdge, Left, Right, Top, Bottom.
    * Style changes:
      New window.label.(un)focused.{justify,border{Color,Width}},
      which fallback to window.label.{justify,border{Color,Width}} before
      - this has the backwards-incompatible effect that
        toolbar.iconbar.(un)focused.* fallback first to toolbar.iconbar.* 
        and then to window.label.* window.{justify,border{Color,Width}}
      New style items: 
      window.(un)focus.border{Width,Color}
    * New or updated translations: 
      - de_AT
      - de_CH
      - mk_MK
      - zh_TW
    * Added -list-commands command line option, which prints a list of 
      valid fluxbox commands.

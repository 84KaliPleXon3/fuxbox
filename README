Compile and Install:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  and then as root
  # make install


Cross-Compile for Windows:

  You'll want mingw-cross-env installed, with libX11 and mingw-catgets built.
  A configure line that works is:
  $ ./configure \
        --prefix=/ \
        --host=i686-pc-mingw32 \
        --disable-imlib2 \
        --disable-xmb \
        --disable-slit \
        --disable-remember \
        --disable-toolbar \
        --disable-fribidi \
        --disable-nls \
        --disable-xft \
        LIBS="-lxcb -lXdmcp -lXau -lpthread -lws2_32"

  Then, build and install with
  $ make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/stage

  You can then copy the whole "stage" directory to a Windows machine and
  run it on your choice of X server.

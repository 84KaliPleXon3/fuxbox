.SH "NAME"
fluxbox - A lightweight window manager for the X Windowing System
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIfluxbox\fR [\-rc rcfile] [\-log logfile] [\-display display] [\-screen scr,scr|all] [\-verbose]
.sp
\fIfluxbox\fR [\-v | \-version] | [\-h | \-help] | [\-i | \-info] | [\-list\-commands]
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
fluxbox(1) provides configurable window decorations, a root menu to launch applications and a toolbar that shows the current workspace name, a set of application names and the current time\. There is also a workspace menu to add or remove workspaces\. The `slit\' can be used to dock small applications; e\.g\. most of the bbtools can use the slit\.
.sp
fluxbox(1) can iconify windows to the toolbar, in addition to adding the window to the \fIIcons\fR submenu of the workspace menu\. One click and they reappear\. A double\-click on the titlebar of the window will \fIshade\fR it; i\.e\. the window will disappear, and only the titlebar will remain visible\.
.sp
fluxbox(1) uses its own graphics class to render its images on the fly\. By using style files, you can determine in great detail how your desktop looks\. fluxbox styles are compatible with those of Blackbox 0\.65 or earlier versions, so users migrating can still use their current favourite themes\.
.sp
fluxbox(1) supports the majority of the Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH) specification, as well as numerous other Window Hinting standards\. This allows all compliant window managers to provide a common interface to standard features used by applications and desktop utilities\.

.SH "STARTING FLUXBOX"
fluxbox(1) comes with a program called startfluxbox(8) usually located wherever you installed fluxbox\. This script provides you with many options and variables that can be set when starting fluxbox\. To actually call fluxbox and begin using it, you should place "exec startfluxbox" in your /\.xinitrc or /\.xsession (depending on your distribution and/or display manager) as the last executed command\. This is assuming that the location of fluxbox(1) and startfluxbox(8) are in your shell\'s $PATH\. Also note that you may need to create the /\.xinitrc file or your setup may use /\.xsession instead, depending on your X setup\. For more information on your shell, please visit your shell\'s manual page\.
.sp
By using fluxbox \-i you\'ll see the defaults used by fluxbox(1)\. These are what fluxbox looks for upon startup\. In the list of `Defaults:\' you\'ll see a menu file location, this is where you can provide a system\-wide menu file for your users\.
.sp
On exit or restart, fluxbox will save user defaults in the file ~/\.fluxbox/init\. Resources in this file can be edited by hand\. fluxbox also has many tools to edit these; look through the main menu once fluxbox has started to find different ways of managing your session\.
.sp
.SH "USING FLUXBOX"
When using fluxbox for the first time, users who are more accustomed to full desktop environments such as KDE or Gnome may be a little surprised by the minimal screen content\. fluxbox is designed to be fast and powerful, so it may take a bit of getting used to \(em however, the rewards are worthwhile\.
.sp
In this section, we\'ll give a quick summary of the common things\. However, we recommend that you consult the referenced sections of this manual to further develop your understanding of what you can do with fluxbox\.
.sp
.SS "Root Window (Main)"
Looking at the fluxbox desktop immediately after startup you\'ll generally see only one thing: the toolbar\. If you right click (mouse button 3) somewhere on the desktop, you can access the RootMenu\. A middle click (mouse button 2) on the desktop shows you the WorkspaceMenu\.
.sp
.SS "RootMenu and WorkspaceMenu"
From the RootMenu you can launch applications and configure fluxbox\. The WorkspaceMenu shows all windows and on which workspaces they are\. See section MENUS on how to customize these menus\.
.sp
.SS "Toolbar"
The toolbar contains any combination of the following tools:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'
\fBWorkspace Name\fR: Name of the current visible workspace
.RE
.sp

\fBWorkspace Arrows\fR: Previous/Next Workspace
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'
\fBWindow Arrows\fR: Previous/Next Application Window
.RE
The contents of the toolbar can be configured in the `init\' file\. We discuss the `init\' file at great length in the RESOURCES section\.
.sp
.SS "Slit"
Initially you won\'t be able to see the slit\. It is there, but it isn\'t being used yet\. The slit confuses some people initially\. Think of it as a dock where you can place smaller programs\. If you\'ve looked at any screenshots on the official fluxbox web site, you will have noticed some small programs on the edge of some of the screens\. These were more than likely docked programs in the slit\. To learn more about the slit, we have an entire section below that goes into detail about the options you have\.
.sp
.SS "Layers"
fluxbox manages the following layers (from highest to lowest):
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'Above Dock
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'Dock

.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'Bottom
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'Desktop
.RE
Windows on a higher layer will always appear above those on a lower one\. These layers can be used on application windows, the slit or the toolbar\. You can assign applications to a certain layer by specifying it in the `apps\' file or through the WindowMenu\. We discuss the `apps\' file in the APPLICATIONS section\. We discuss the WindowMenu in the MENUS section\. We discuss layers in more detail in the LAYERS section\.
.sp
.SS "Focus Model"
The window that has the focus is the one that receives key and mouse events\. The focus model is selectable via the Configuration menu located in the root menu\. We\'ll discuss the different types of focus below in the FOCUS MODEL section\.
.sp
.SS "Windows"
A left click (mouse button 1) on any part of the window\'s border will raise it\. Dragging then moves the window to another part of the desktop\. A right click and drag on the border resizes the window\. Dragging the resize grips at the left and right bottom corners also will resize the window\. Middle clicking on a border or titlebar will immediately lower the window\. Right clicking on the titlebar opens the Window menu\. The commands unique to this menu are discussed in detail in the Window Menu section of MENUS\.
.sp
.SS "Tabs"
fluxbox allows windows to be `grouped\' by middle clicking and holding on a window\'s tab and dragging it onto another window\. This `tabbing\' allows you to put multiple applications in one location on the desktop and do several operations (for example, moving or resizing) to all windows in the group\. By default, tabs are located just above the window, but they may be embedded in the titlebar or moved to other locations on the outside of the window\. Configuration is discussed in TAB OPTIONS section\.
.sp
.SH "MENUS"
fluxbox installs a default menu file in @pkgdatadir@/menu\. You can also use fluxbox \-i to confirm this action\. Of course this system\-wide menu can be customized for all users at once, but it is also possible to create an individual menu file for each user\. By convention, users create a menu file in ~/\.fluxbox/menu \. Once you\'ve created your own menu file, you\'ll want to make sure that you properly declare this location in your `init\' file so that fluxbox knows where to look\. The value you\'ll want to add or change is:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
session\.menuFile: <menufile>
.fi
.RE
For this change to take effect, fluxbox must be restarted\. Be sure that your menu is usable, then choose `Restart\' from the default fluxbox root menu\. This restart is only necessary if you make changes to the `init\' file; otherwise, fluxbox will automatically detect your changes\.
.sp
.SS "Root Menu"
The root menu is where you can change different aspects of fluxbox by simply clicking on a menu item\. Most of the changes in this menu can also be done in the `init\' file\. However it makes it very easy to change certain options without having to open up an editor and find the resource\. In the root menu, you usually have a `fluxbox menu\' or `Settings\' submenu, where you will find lots of different options\. We\'ll take a look at most, if not all, of those here\.
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'
\fBConfigure\fR: The next level under this menu is where you can set certain resources and really begin to customize the look and feel of your desktop\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'
\fBSystem Styles\fR: This is where the standard styles are listed\. You can select one of these by clicking on it\. You may have to `reload\' the config or `restart\' to get every graphical element to change to the new style\. System styles are located in @pkgdatadir@/styles/ upon a default install\. Remember that you can confirm this with fluxbox \-i\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'
\fBUser Styles\fR: ~/\.fluxbox/styles This is the location where you will store new styles that you grab from the Internet\. If you create your own styles this is also where you will put yours (provided that you follow the
\fIstandards\fR
described in fluxstyle(1))\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'

.SS "Workspace Menu"
The workspace menu can be found by middle clicking on the background\. A menu will popup giving you the option to add or remove a workspace\. You will also see your workspaces listed there; middle clicking on a workspace name will take you to that workspace, whereas clicking on a window name in one of the per\-workspace submenus will take you to the workspace that window is on, and select the window\. Last but not least you will notice the Icons menu\. This is for applications which have been `iconified\'\.
.sp
.SS "Menu Behavior"
The behavior of the submenus in a menu can be configured in the `init\' file, with the following entries (default for both is 0):

session\.screen0\.menuDelayClose: <msec>
.fi
.RE
.SS "Menu Syntax"
There are up to four fields in a menu line\. They are of the form:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
[tag] (label|filename) {command|filename} <icon file>
.fi
.RE
The supported tags are:
.PP
[begin] (label)
.RS 4
This tells fluxbox to start parsing the menu file\. This tag is required for fluxbox to read your menu file\. If it cannot find it, the system default menu is used in its place\.
.RE
.PP
[end]
.RS 4
This tells fluxbox that it is at the end of a menu\. This can either be a submenu or the main root menu\. There must be at least one of these tags in your menu to correspond to the required [begin] tag\.
.RE
.PP
[exec] (label) {command}
.RS 4
Inserts a command item into the menu\. When you select the menu item from the menu, fluxbox runs
\fIcommand\fR\.
.RE
.PP
[exit] (label)
.RS 4
Inserts an item that shuts down and exits fluxbox\. Any open windows are reparented to the root window before fluxbox exits\.
.RE
.PP
[include] (file\-or\-directory\-name)
.RS 4
Parses the file specified by filename inline with the current menu\. The filename can be the full path to a file or it can begin with ~/, which will be expanded into your home directory\. If the path is a directory, then all files in the directory are included\.
.RE
.PP
[nop] (label)
.RS 4
Insert a non\-operational item into the current menu\. This can be used to help format the menu into blocks or sections if so desired\. This tag does support a label, but one is not required in which case a blank item will be used instead\.
.RE
.PP
[separator]
.RS 4
This will create a nice separation line\. Useful for splitting up sections in a
\fIpretty\fR
way\.
.RE
.PP
[style] (label) {filename}
.RS 4
This tells fluxbox to insert an item that, when selected, reads style file named filename and apply the new textures, colors and fonts to the current running session\.
.RE
.PP
[stylesmenu] (directory)
.RS 4
Reads all filenames from the specified directory, assuming that they are all valid style files, and creates menu items in the current menu for every filename, that, when selected by the user will apply the selected style file to the current session\. The labels that are created in the menu are the filenames of the style files\.
.RE
.PP
[stylesdir] (label) {directory}
.RS 4
Creates a submenu entry with label (that is also the title of the new submenu), and inserts in that submenu all filenames in the specified directory, assuming that they are all valid style files (directories are ignored) in the same way as the [stylesdir] command does\. Both [stylesdir] and [stylesmenu] commands make it possible to install style files without editing your init file\.
.RE
.PP
[submenu] (label) {menutitle}
.RS 4
This tells fluxbox to create and parse a new menu\. This menu is inserted as a submenu into the parent menu\. These menus are parsed recursively, so there is no limit to the number of levels or nested submenus you can have\. The title for the new menu is optional, if none is supplied, the new menu\'s title is the same as the item label\. An [end] tag is required to end the submenu\.
.RE
.PP
[reconfig] (label)
.RS 4
When selected this item re\-reads the current style and menu files and applies any changes\. This is useful for creating a new style or theme, as you don\'t have to constantly restart fluxbox every time you save your style\. However, fluxbox automatically rereads the menu whenever it changes\.
.RE
.PP
[restart] (label) {command}
.RS 4
This tells fluxbox to restart\. If command is supplied, it shuts down and runs the command (which is commonly the name of another window manager)\. If the command is omitted, fluxbox restarts itself\.
.RE
.PP
[config] (label)
.RS 4
Inserts a fluxbox native submenu item, containing numerous configuration options concerning window placement, focus style, window moving style, etc\.
.RE
.PP
[wallpapers] (label)
.RS 4
This allows you to list your backgrounds\. This tag is built in to use fbsetbg(1) and allows you to simply click on an image to set your wallpaper\. See? fluxbox makes it easy\&...
.RE
.PP
[wallpapermenu] (directory) {command}
.RS 4
This inserts a menu item to set the wallpaper for each file in the given directory\. The command is optional and defaults to fbsetbg\.
.RE
.PP
[workspaces] (label)
.RS 4
This tells fluxbox to insert a link to the workspaces menu directly into your menu\. This is handy for those users who can\'t access the workspace menu directly (e\.g\. if you don\'t have a 3 button mouse, it is rather hard to middle click to show the workspace menu)\.
.RE
Any line that starts with a \fI#\fR or \fI!\fR is considered a comment and ignored by fluxbox\. Also, in the label/command/filename fields you can escape any character\. Using \fI\e\e\fR inserts a literal back\-slash into the label/command/filename field\.
.sp
Here is an example menu file:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
# fluxbox menu file
[begin] (fluxbox)
    [exec] (rxvt) {rxvt \-ls} </usr/X11R6/share/icons/terminal\.xpm>

.SH "RESOURCES"
Usually the ~/\.fluxbox/init resource file is created and maintained by fluxbox itself\. You can use the [config] menu to set most of these options\. However, we\'ll cover all of the resource options that are available to the user\. If you edit this file while fluxbox is running, you must `reconfigure\' to reload the resource options\.
.sp
When running fluxbox in a multiple desktop environment the screen0 key can also be screen1, screen2, etc\. You can customize the behavior of fluxbox on each desktop accordingly\. Here are the resources that are currently available:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
session\.screen0\.window\.focus\.alpha: <integer>
session\.screen0\.window\.unfocus\.alpha: <integer>
      These resources are available to the user to set different levels of
      transparency for different components of fluxbox\. Each one accepts a value
      between 0\-255, 255 being opaque and 0 being completely transparent\.
      Default: 255

session\.screen0\.slit\.autoHide: <boolean>
session\.screen0\.toolbar\.autoHide: <boolean>
      The autoHide resources allow the user to set the behavior of the toolbar
      and slit\. This behavior can be that they disappear when they are not being
      used actively by the user, or they remain visible at all times\. Default:
      False

session\.screen0\.windowScrollAction: shade|nexttab
      This allows you to execute a command by scrolling on the titlebar of a
      window\. For `shade\', scrolling down will shade the window, and scrolling
      up will unshade it\. For `nexttab\', scrolling down will focus the next tab,
      and scrolling up will focus the previous one\. Default: <blank>

session\.screen0\.windowScrollReverse: <boolean>
      This switches the role of scrolling up and scrolling down for the previous
      resource\. Default: False

session\.screen0\.slit\.layer: <layer>
session\.screen0\.toolbar\.layer: <layer>
      With these two resources, you can set the layer you want the toolbar and
      the slit to appear on\. Please read the LAYER section for more information\.
      Default: Dock

session\.screen0\.slit\.placement: <placement>
session\.screen0\.toolbar\.placement: <placement>
      These allow users to place the slit and toolbar where they like\. Possible
      options are:
      \-   BottomCenter
      \-   BottomLeft
      \-   BottomRight
      \-   LeftBottom
      \-   LeftCenter
      \-   LeftTop
      \-   RightBottom
      \-   RightCenter

      \-   TopLeft
      \-   TopRight

session\.screen0\.slit\.maxOver: <boolean>
session\.screen0\.toolbar\.maxOver: <boolean>
session\.screen0\.tabs\.maxOver: <boolean>
      Setting these to True will allow application windows to maximize over the
      complete screen\. Setting to False allows the slit, toolbar, and external
      tabs to hold their territory and will always be visible when an
      application is maximized\. Default: False

session\.screen0\.toolbar\.height: <integer>
      Set the height of the toolbar\. If the value is set to 0, the style file
      will gain control over the toolbar height\. It is possible to set a fixed
      height by changing this value to something greater than 0\. Default: 0

session\.screen0\.toolbar\.visible: <boolean>
      The user can set whether they want to have a toolbar on screen at all\.
      Setting to False removes the toolbar from the screen\. Default: True

session\.screen0\.toolbar\.widthPercent: <integer>
      This resource sets the width percentage of the toolbar on the screen\.
      Default: 65

session\.screen0\.toolbar\.tools: <tools>
      This resource specifies the tools plugged into the toolbar\. Read the
      TOOLBAR section in this manual for a description of each of these\.

      \-   systemtray
      \-   workspacename

session\.screen0\.slit\.onhead: <integer>
session\.screen0\.toolbar\.onhead: <integer>
      For those that use xinerama, users can set this value to the number of the
      head where they would like to see the slit and toolbar, starting from 1\.
      Setting this to 0 will ignore xinerama information\. Default: 0

session\.screen0\.iconbar\.mode: <pattern>
      This determines which windows will be displayed in the iconbar\. Any window
      pattern available to the Next/PrevWindow keybindings is acceptable\.
      Default: {static groups} (workspace)

session\.screen0\.iconbar\.usePixmap: <boolean>
      This is also set in the Iconbar Mode menu\. When set to True, this will
      show the native icon of applications\. Default: True

session\.screen0\.iconbar\.iconTextPadding: <integer>
      This specifies the space between the window title and the edge of the
      button\. Default: 10

      `man XSetLineAttributes\' for more details\. Defaults: listed above

session\.screen0\.slit\.direction: Vertical|Horizontal
      This specifies whether clients in the slit are arranged horizontally or
      vertically\. Default: Vertical

session\.screen0\.strftimeFormat: <date>

      This specifies the width of external tabs in pixels\. Default: 64

session\.screen0\.userFollowModel: <model>
      This specifies the behavior when a window on another workspace becomes the
      active window\. `Ignore\' does nothing\. `Follow\' moves to the window\'s
      workspace\. `Current\' moves the window to the current workspace\.
      `SemiFollow\' acts like `Current\' for minimized windows and like `Follow\'
      otherwise\. Default: Follow

session\.screen0\.followModel: <model>
      This specifies the behavior when a window on another workspace requests to
      be focused\. `Ignore\' does nothing, and `Follow\' uses the setting in
      session\.screen0\.userFollowModel\. Default: Ignore

session\.screen0\.focusModel: ClickToFocus|MouseFocus
      This controls how windows gain focus via the mouse\. With `ClickToFocus\',
      the user must click on the window\. With `MouseFocus\', windows gain focus
      whenever the mouse moves over them\. Default: ClickToFocus

session\.screen0\.autoRaise: <boolean>
      When True, this setting automatically raises any window that gains focus\.
      Default: True

session\.autoRaiseDelay: <integer>
      Adjusts the delay (in milli\-sec) before focused windows will raise
      when using the Autoraise option\. Default: 250

session\.screen0\.clickRaises: <boolean>
      This setting allows a user to click anywhere on a window to bring it on
      top of other windows\. Otherwise, only the titlebar will work\. Default:
      True

session\.screen0\.workspacewarping: <boolean>
      This setting enables a user to change workspaces by dragging a window
      across the edge of the screen\. Default: True

session\.screen0\.showwindowposition: <boolean>
      Setting this resource to True shows the user, in a little window,
      the exact position of the application window while the user is
      dragging it\. Allows a precise placement of windows on a screen\.
      Default: True

session\.screen0\.decorateTransient: <boolean>
      This controls whether or not transient windows get certain window
      decorations, currently the maximize button and handle\.
      Default: True

session\.screen0\.defaultDeco: <string>
      This specifies the default window decorations, according to the same
      options available to the `[Deco]\' option in the `apps\' file, described in
      the APPLICATIONS section\. Default: NORMAL\.

session\.screen0\.menuMode: Delay|Click
      This setting controls the circumstances under which submenus open\. With
      `Click\', the user must click on the menu item in order for the submenu to
      open\. With `Delay\', submenus open when the mouse hovers over the menu
      item\. Default: Delay

session\.screen0\.menuDelay: <integer>
      This sets the delay in milliseconds for submenus to open with the previous
      option set to `Delay\'\. Default: 0

session\.screen0\.menuDelayClose: 0
      This value sets the delay in milliseconds that you would like the menu to
      remain visible after you\'ve clicked out of it\. Default: 0

session\.screen0\.focusNewWindows: <boolean>
      This sets whether or not new windows will become focused automatically\.
      Default: True

session\.screen0\.workspaceNames: <names>
      Here is where the user can name their workspaces\. However it is
      recommended to use the tool available in the Configuration Menu to set
      these\. Default: one, two, three, four

session\.screen0\.edgeSnapThreshold: <integer>
      When moving a window across your screen, fluxbox is able to have it `snap\'
      to the edges of the screen and other windows for easy placement\. This
      variable tells fluxbox the distance (in pixels) at which the window will
      jump to the edge\. Default: 0

session\.screen0\.windowPlacement: <placement strategy>
      This resource specifies where to place new windows when not otherwise
      specified (by the program or the `apps\' file, for example)\. Here are the
      options:
      \- RowSmartPlacement: tries to place windows in rows without overlapping
      \- ColSmartPlacement: tries to place windows in columns without overlapping
      \- CascadePlacement: places windows below the titlebar of the previous one
      \- UnderMousePlacement: places new windows underneath the mouse
      Default: RowSmartPlacement

session\.screen0\.rowPlacementDirection: LeftToRight|RightToLeft
session\.screen0\.colPlacementDirection: TopToBottom|BottomToTop
      These settings control the direction in which windows are tiled using the
      RowSmartPlacement and ColSmartPlacement strategies described above\.
      Default: LeftToRight/TopToBottom

session\.screen0\.fullMaximization: <boolean>
      If this setting is enabled, windows will maximize over the toolbar, slit,
      and any other window that creates a strut, no matter what their individual
      settings are\. Default: False

session\.screen0\.rootCommand: <command>
      This runs a command when fluxbox starts, intended for setting a default
      background\. If you want to override backgrounds set by styles, you should
      add `background: none\' to your style overlay (see section STYLE OVERLAY)\.
      NOTE: Setting this command can be dangerous\. Please make sure you know
      what you are doing when setting this resource to a value other than a
      desktop wallpaper command\.

session\.screen0\.imageDither: <boolean>
      This controls whether or not fluxbox created dithered images\. Default:
      False

session\.screen0\.opaqueMove: <boolean>
      When moving a window, setting this to True will draw the window
      contents as it moves (this is nasty on slow systems)\. If False, it
      will only draw an outline of the window border\. Default: False

session\.screen0\.workspaces: <integer>
      Set this to the number of workspaces the users wants\. Default: 4

session\.menuFile: <location>
session\.slitlistFile: <location>
session\.styleFile: <location>
session\.styleOverlay: <location>
      All of these resources require a pathname to their specific files\. This is
      where you can specify different files\. Most of the defaults will be
      located in the user\'s ~/\.fluxbox directory\.

session\.cacheLife: <integer>
      This tells fluxbox how long (in minutes) unused pixmaps may stay in the X
      server\'s memory\. Default: 5

session\.cacheMax: <integer>
      This tells fluxbox how much memory (in Kb) it may use to store cached
      pixmaps on the X server\. If your machine runs short of memory, you may
      lower this value\. Default: 200

session\.colorsPerChannel: <integer>
      This tells fluxbox how many colors to take from the X server on
      pseudo\-color displays\. A channel would be red, green, or blue\. fluxbox
      will allocate this variable ^ 3 and make them always available\. Value must
      be between 2\-6\. When you run fluxbox on an 8bpp display, you must set this
      resource to 4\. Default: 4

session\.doubleClickInterval: <integer>
      Adjust the delay in milliseconds between mouse clicks for fluxbox to
      consider a double click\. Default: 250

session\.forcePseudoTransparency: <boolean>
      If you have Xorg\'s composite extension enabled, this setting will force
      the menu, windows, toolbar, and slit to use pseudo\-transparency instead of
      true transparency\. Default: False

session\.ignoreBorder: <boolean>
      This configures the ability to move windows by dragging the border\.
      Default: False

session\.tabPadding: <integer>
      This specifies the spacing between tabs\. Default: 0

session\.tabsAttachArea: Window|Titlebar
      With this set to `Window\', windows may be grouped by dragging one tab with
      the middle mouse button and dropping it anywhere on another window\. With
      `Titlebar\', the user must drop the tab on the target window\'s titlebar\.
      Default: Window

session\.titlebar\.left: Stick
session\.titlebar\.right: Minimize Maximize Close
      The icons to place in the titlebar of decorated windows\. The available
      options are Close, Maximize, MenuIcon, Minimize, Shade, and Stick\.

.SH "LAYERS"
Layers affect the way that windows will overlap each other on the screen\. Windows on a higher layer will always appear above those on a lower one, whether they are focused or not\. By default, fluxbox uses 13 layers, starting from 1 (highest)\. The number of layers can be changed by using the following resource:

.RE
There are two ways to assign a window to a different layer\. When the window is open, you may select the layer in the `Layer \&...\' submenu of the window menu\. The menu gives six choices for the layer, which fluxbox manages by name\. The names are (from highest to lowest layer):

.SH "FOCUS MODEL"
The Focus Model defines how windows gain focus (i\.e\. become the active window, which receives keyboard and mouse events)\. The focus model can be changed in the configuration menu (usually located under \fIfluxbox menu\fR in the Root Menu\.
.sp
There are two main aspects of the focus model: how windows gain focus and how tabs gain focus\. Each of these has two options: focus follows mouse and click to focus\. Focus follows mouse means that windows will gain focus when the mouse hovers over them\. Click to focus means that windows will gain focus when the mouse clicks on them\.
.sp
Thus, there are four main options when choosing a focus model\. You should choose one of the first two and one of the last two\. They are:
.sp

.RE
There is one more option in the focus model menu\. It is called AutoRaise\. When AutoRaise is enabled, focused windows will appear on top of other windows in the same layer\. When AutoRaise is disabled, you must explicitly raise a focused window, using the window menu or keybinding\.
.sp

.SH "STYLES"
fluxbox enables you to use specialized files that contain X(1) resources to specify colors, textures, pixmaps and fonts, and thus the overall look of your window borders, menus and the toolbar\.
.sp
The default installation of fluxbox provides some of these style files\. See fluxstyle(1) to accommodate the growing number of style components\.
.sp
.SH "STYLE OVERLAY"
In addition to the style file, the overlay file, whose location is specified by session\.screen0\.styleOverlay (default: ~/\.fluxbox/overlay ) can be used to set style resources that override all styles\. For more information about which parts of fluxbox can be controlled by the overlay file, see fluxstyle(1)\.
.sp
.SH "APPLICATIONS"
It is possible to force an application to always have the same dimensions, position, and other settings when it is first launched\. This is done using either the window\-menu `Remember\&...\fI submenu, or by directly using the ~/\.fluxbox/apps file\. Be careful about editing the apps file while fluxbox is running\. Your changes may be overwritten\. Following is a listing of the valid entries for the `apps\fR file\. The `Remember\&...\fI submenu has entries for most options that store the current state in the `apps\fR file for future use\.
.sp
The format of a line in the `apps\' file is:
.sp

Each app\-name can be a string, or a regular expression\. By default the name is matched against a window\'s WM_CLASS property (the first string in it, called the "instance")\. You can match against the title, instance name (default), class name, or role (the WM_WINDOW_ROLE property) by explicitly specifying it\. You can also specify multiple matches, which must ALL match for the properties to be applied\. If a count is supplied in curly brackets at the end of the app line, then the entry will only match at most that many at any time (default is to match all matching windows)\.

Finally, you can set windows to group together by using the `apps\' file\. This can be achieved with regular expressions using:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
[app] (property=expr) \.\.\. {number}
.fi

Property can be one of the following tags:

o name \- the name of the window (the first field of WM_CLASS) o class \- class of the window (the second field of WM_CLASS) o title \- title of the window ( WM_NAME property) o role \- role of the window (the WM_WINDOW_ROLE property)
.sp
If no `property\' is specified, the name property is assumed\. You can find out the value for these fields for a particular window by running xprop(1)\.
.sp
You can also place [group] tag around several [app] tags, with an [end] tag to indicate the end of the group\. If you place (workspace) after the [group] tag, a new window will only get grouped with other windows on the current workspace\. You can also specify dimensions, positions, etc\. for the group as for normal app entries\. Here is a short example of an `apps\' file:
.sp

.RE
Parameters in the `apps\' file are case\-sensitive\. Application names are taken from the first X window WM_CLASS attribute by default (WM_NAME = title, WM_WINDOW_ROLE = role)\. You can see this attribute by using the xprop command\. Transient windows are not affected by application settings\. Take care when using regular expressions\. If you are not familiar with regular expressions you can disable this feature by specifying \-\-disable\-regexp during configure\. Plain strings will then be matched\.

\fBClients\fR: This submenu lets you reorder the the applications running in the slit\. You are able to hide apps from the slit by unselecting them in the list showing\. This will not kill the app\. You can make them appear by selecting them in the list\. The "Save SlitList" option saves the new order to you slitlist located in ~/\.fluxbox (useful if you reordered the apps with the cycle option)\.

.SH "SLITLIST FILE"
fluxbox\'s slitlist file is available for those that use dockapps in the slit\. This file helps fluxbox keep track of the \fBorder\fR of the dockapps when in the slit\. The file is generally located at ~/\.fluxbox/slitlist
.sp
A simple procedure for getting the slit sequences the way you like it is: 1\. Run fluxbox with no pre\-loaded dockapps 2\. Run dockapps individually in the order you want them 3\. Add dockapps to your auto\-run script, or better yet your startfluxbox(8) script\.
.sp
This sequence will be saved by default to ~/\.fluxbox/slitlist and will be remembered for future instances of fluxbox\.
.sp
Users are free to manually edit the slitlist file\. It is a simple list of window names, as given by xprop(1), one per dockapp\. Similar to the init file it should not be edited while fluxbox is running\. Otherwise changes may get overwritten\.
.sp
The user also has the option of choosing a different path for the slitlist file\. The following is the init file component that needs to be changed:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
session\.session0\.slitlistFile: <filename>

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"

HOME
.RS 4
fluxbox uses HOME to find the \.fluxbox/init file and to resolve style file and \-directory names\.
.RE
.PP
DISPLAY
.RS 4
When no other display was given on the command line, fluxbox will start on the display specified by this variable\.
.RE
fluxbox can also take advantage of other environment variables if they are set before fluxbox is started\. For example, if $TERM is set, then it will be available whenever fluxbox uses the shell, such as certain commands in the keys and menu files\. So one can do:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Mod1 x ExecCommand :$TERM
.fi

For more information about environment variables, see your shell\'s manual\.
